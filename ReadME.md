### Art Piece 1

Zach Lieberman’s work “Reface” is an interactive user experience in which the installation records brief videos of a viewer’s mouth, eyes, and eyebrows and mixes them up into a random combination. Reface uses face-tracking technology to capture these parts of a person’s face in every video. In other words, the person can move around in front of the installation and it will still capture their features, allowing for less serious and more spontaneous expressions. When the user blinks this “edits” the video clips and advances it to the next combination of faces.

I enjoyed this piece because it is entirely dependent on who visits the exhibit, and what expression he/she chooses to make in front of the camera. The final product, though it constantly changes, is always a unique blend of different identities, personalities, and physical characteristics. Lieberman’s idea of a “group portrait” brings together users that have never met. It creates a collective group experience through art.

### Art Piece 2

Lauren McCarthy’s piece “LAUREN” is a unique meditation on Amazon’s Alexa in which the artist acts as a human version of this AI for people in their own homes. LAUREN controls the lights, AC, door locks, and can even give suggestions on what to wear or how to act. The AI tries not only to fulfill needs, but also to anticipate them. McCarthy states that the piece is intended to investigate the relationships and tensions between intimacy vs. privacy, convenience vs. human agency, and human labor vs. automation.

Watching this piece feels like watching a documentary film. It is not until the end that the viewer understands what really was underlying the video the entire time: these tensions mentioned above. The piece not only investigates the potential invasive nature of a product like Amazon’s Alexa, but, even further, also tries to understand how the quality of that product would be different if it were human-driven. In addition, the video shows us what we are sacrificing in terms of agency and individuality by trying to make things more convenient.
